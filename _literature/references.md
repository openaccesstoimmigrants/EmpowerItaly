## [IMMIGRATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25836/w25836.pdf)
After the bibliography, at page 39, they present a dual-axis chart. In the x-axes, we have time, divided into `Decade`, while in the first y-axes, we have `GDP growth rate`, and in the second one (on the right), the `Net immigration rate`.

## [Integrating the non-EU immigrants into the EU labour market. An econometric analysis of some of the specific factors](https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/mmcks-2020-0021)
The article explores the impact of some specific barriers to the integration of non-EUimmigrants on the European Union labour market, measuring the influence of age, level of educationand investments on the employment rate of non-EU immigrants.

## [The jobs and effects of migrant workers in Italy](Readings/The jobs and effects of migrant workers in Italy.pdf)
It gives a panoramic on the post-Thatcherian and post-Brexit scenario.

## [THE IMMIGRATION EFFECT](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/gdp#howitworks)
Interesting graphs where they simulate GDP growth based on the number of immigrants. "Let’s back up a little bit and take a look at how U.S. economic growth is calculated in the first place. Two important factors that go into the equation are the number of people in the labor force and how productive they are. In the past 50 years, we’ve had an average GDP growth of around 3 percent, about half of which came from a growing labor force and half from their productivity (more recent years have hovered closer to 2 percent)."

## [Why Unemployment Is Lower When Immigration Is Higher](https://www.cato.org/blog/why-unemployment-lower-when-immigration-higher)
An interesting chart compares `Immigration Rate` and `Unemployment` over `Time`. "To be clear, immigrants are not causing the unemployment rate to move up or down. The economic literature on this point is quite unambiguous: immigrants cause essentially no effect on the unemployment rate one way or another. Rather, the causation is the other direction. Immigrants come during periods of economic growth when companies are hiring new workers, both immigrants and natives."

## [What do immigrants do for the UK economy? Nine charts Conservative ministers seem to be ignoring](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/immigration-uk-economy-what-are-the-benefits-stats-theresa-may-amber-rudd-tory-conference-speeches-2016-a7346121.html)
The article presents different charts to answer questions about the correlation between immigration and GDP. In particular, they use a scatter plot to examine changes in `Wages` and `Number of immigrants`.

## [How immigrants are saving the Italian economy and pensions](https://openmigration.org/en/op-ed/how-immigrants-are-saving-the-italian-economy-and-pensions/)
An example, focusing on the Italian case, showcasing graphs that illustrate the relationship between more immigrant workers and pensions.

## [How does immigration affect the U.S. economy?](https://thesciencebehindit.org/how-does-immigration-affect-the-u-s-economy/)
This source answers key questions briefly. "Research shows that the arrival of immigrants with skills complementary to those of native workers may increase earnings for those native workers. For example, if foreign-born construction workers enter the market, causing construction workers’ wages to decrease, construction companies often respond by hiring more construction workers. That can trigger a need for more supervisors to oversee and coordinate the larger workforce, which, in turn, increases the demand for—and therefore the wages of—the supervisors."

## AI HINTS
We can create more than one graph to present our hypothesis, and in that case, we could include:
- A line graph showing the total number of immigrant arrivals over the years.
- A bar chart or line graph depicting the unemployment rate or labor force participation rate over the same time period.
- A scatter plot to visualize the relationship between immigrant arrivals and the employment rate or wage levels.
In this case, we will need data on `Unemployment Rate`, `Total Arrivals`, and/or `Wage Levels`, and probably also `GDP Rate`.

Creating a single graph that effectively represents the relationship between the number of immigrant arrivals, the unemployment rate, and GDP can be challenging due to the different scales and units of these variables. However, we can create a composite graph with multiple y-axes to display these variables together.

Here's a general approach to create a composite graph to represent the relationship between immigrant arrivals, the unemployment rate, and GDP:

Time Period: Use a common time period for your data to ensure a meaningful comparison. This could be years or quarters.

Scaling: Normalize the data to bring them to a common scale. For example, you could use Z-scores or min-max scaling to standardize the variables.

Graph Type: Choose a graph type that accommodates multiple y-axes. A line chart or a dual-axis chart would be suitable.

Y-Axes: Create separate y-axes for each variable. One for immigrant arrivals, one for the unemployment rate, and one for GDP.

Keep in mind that while a composite graph can provide a high-level view of the relationships between these variables, it may not capture all the nuances and interactions. It's important to supplement this with other graphs and statistical analysis in your project documentation to provide a comprehensive answer to your research question.
