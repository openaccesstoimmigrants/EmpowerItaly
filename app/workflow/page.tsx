                            <p>From the project's inception, our aim was to conduct a comprehensive study on the presence of immigrants in Italy. Given the sensitivity of the topic, framing a viable research question posed a challenge. Initially, our focus centered on aspects of the labor market and education, specifically examining whether the professional positions held by foreigners corresponded with their educational qualifications. However, the scarcity of relevant data at the regional level in Italy prompted us to transition into the exploratory phase, where we formulated a well-defined hypothesis.</p>

                            <p>The project leveraged data from reputable sources, namely ISTAT and EUROSTAT, both housing extensive data repositories beneficial for students and various organizations. Notably, ISTAT's dedicated page on immigrant statistics in Italy, accessible through its older data explorer, proved invaluable. Despite encountering dynamic changes in the data presentation methods of these institutions during the project's development, such as ISTAT's transition from its [old data explorer](http://dati.istat.it/) to the [new one](https://esploradati.istat.it/databrowser/#/), the abundance of data remained consistent, ensuring a robust foundation for our analysis. Additionally, organizations like OECD, previously considered in earlier project phases, underwent transitions in their data explorer interfaces.</p>

                            <p>The EmpowerItaly datasets compile data from catalogs concerning diverse aspects of the Italian labor market. Originating from a University of Bologna course, the catalog is not actively maintained anymore, but the datasets within it are managed by their respective institutions. Despite the catalog's lack of ongoing updates, our accessible scripts can be run on new files as needed.
