## **[WHAT]**  
üîç In this folder you'll find...  <br>
2 main Jupyter Notebook used to analyze and visualize: <br>
- additional data visualizations for explicative purposes (1)
- final data mashup visualization (2) <br>

## **[WHY]** 
As you will have the opportunity to see on the website, the mashup phase is less about reaching a 'conclusive point' about our thesis and more about opening up borders of expectations about data, to find reach insights and useful points for a change of perspective about data. <br>
This is what we can call the "divergent phase" - following the double diamond approach. <br>
