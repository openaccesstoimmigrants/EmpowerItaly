# EmpowerItaly: Exploring Immigrants' Contribution to Italian Economic Growth

## Possible hypothesis questions:

## A - Are immigrants in Italy more likely to be unemployed compared to the native population?

### This hypothesis question addresses the potential difference in unemployment rates between immigrants and native Italians. It allows you to investigate the labor market dynamics and assess whether there might be disparities in employment opportunities for immigrants.

## B - Do immigrants contribute to the economic growth of Italy through their entrepreneurial activities?

### This hypothesis question focuses on the potential positive impact of immigrants on the economy by examining their entrepreneurial endeavors. It allows to investigate whether immigrants create new businesses, generate employment opportunities, and contribute to the overall economic development of Italy.

## 1. Introduction

Our project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of immigration in Italy. This topic is widely discussed by Italian politicians, but it is often based on assumptions rather than data. For instance, some people claim that "Italy has been invaded by migrants," as reported by articles like "[Siamo invasi dai migranti, la più grande tra le fake news](https://www.huffingtonpost.it/archivio/2017/06/28/news/siamo_invasi_dai_migranti_la_piu_grande_tra_le_fake_news-10640403/)." Other statements, like "an ethnic replacement is in act in order to delete Italian culture," are even more absurd, as reported by the article "[Italian minister sparks fury for saying immigration leads to ‘ethnic replacement’](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/19/europe/italy-immigration-lollobrigida-intl/index.html)."

We acknowledge that immigration is a complex topic that requires a multidimensional approach. Therefore, we focus on the contribution of migrants to the national economy as our main research question. Specifically, our hypothesis question explores the potential positive impact of immigrants on the economy by examining their entrepreneurial activities. We aim to investigate whether immigrants create new businesses, generate employment opportunities, and contribute to the overall economic development of Italy.

## 2. Scenario

EmpowerItaly aligns data from various sources to generate insights about past and current migrational flows throughout Italy. Specifically, we are interested in how the number of entrants has changed over time, and in analyzing where people are moving to and from. Additionally, we aim to analyze the level of education to explore active participation in Italy's economy. 

In order to obtain an exhaustive picture of the phenomenon, we will align:

1. Immigrants' nationality and distribution
2. Compare the educational level of both Italians and immigrants
3. Average salary and criminal rate per region
4. Employment and unemployment rate

### 2.1. The Open Data scenario

We believe in Open Data and want to integrate our project into the larger picture proposed by the United Nations and the [17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](notion://www.notion.so/%5B%3Chttps://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/%3E)), which were developed by an Open Working Group of 30 member states over a two-year process. The SDGs are designed to balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. Open Data can help achieve the SDGs by providing critical information on natural resources, government operations, public services, and population demographics. These insights can inform national priorities and help determine the most effective paths for action on national issues. In particular, for our project, we refer to the 16th goal: ***Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.*** The kind of government transparency provided by Open Data is critical to making institutions more accountable and inclusive.

### 2.2. The aims of EmpowerItaly

1. **Analyze the nature of the datasets**, its legal basis, ownership, quality, and accuracy, and ensure compliance with privacy rules in the EU.
2. **Analyze the datasets from an ethical point of view** to avoid discrimination, cognitive biases, and prejudice.
3. **Produce Linked Open Datasets as output**, including DCAT_AP metadata and license RDF.
4. **Design and develop visualizations** to effectively communicate and exploit the results.

## 3. Original datasets and mashup datasets

## 4. Quality analysis of the datasets

This section considers the requirements, established according to the "Linee guida per la valorizzazione del patrimonio informativo pubblico" by AGID [https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati](https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/bozza/aspettiorg.html#qualita-dei-dati)). The four characteristics to control the level of information quality are:

- **Accuracy** (syntactic and semantic) - the data, and its attributes, correctly represent the real value of the concept or event to which it refers;
- **Coherence** - the data, and its attributes are not contradictory to other data regarding the context of the use of the owner administration;
- **Completeness** - the data is exhaustive for all its expected values and with respect to the relative entities (sources) that contribute to the definition of the procedure;
- **Currentness** (or timeliness of updating) - the data, and its attributes is of the "right time" (it is updated) with respect to the procedure to which it refers.

|  | Accuracy | Coherence | Completeness | Curentness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| D2 |  |  |  |  |
| D3 |  |  |  |  |
| D4 |  |  |  |  |

## 5. Legal analysis (privacy, license, purpose, etc.)

This analysis is designed to assess compliance with legal and ethical aspects in accordance with European, state and local regulations and compliance with good practices relating to publication in open data.

The analysis pays particular attention to aspects related to privacy, licenses, and interest for the purpose of creating a service that balances the public function, transparency and rights of individual citizens.
